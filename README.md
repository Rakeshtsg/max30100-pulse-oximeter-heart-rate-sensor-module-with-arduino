# max30100-pulse-oximeter-heart-rate-sensor-module-with-arduino

To get started with using the MAX30100 pulse oximeter heart rate sensor module with Arduino, you will first need to make sure that you have the following:

An Arduino board (such as an Arduino Uno)
The MAX30100 pulse oximeter heart rate sensor module
A breadboard and jumper wires
Once you have all of these components, you can connect the MAX30100 module to your Arduino board using the following steps:

Connect the VCC pin on the MAX30100 module to the 5V pin on your Arduino board.
Connect the GND pin on the MAX30100 module to one of the GND pins on your Arduino board.
Connect the SDA pin on the MAX30100 module to the A4 pin on your Arduino board.
Connect the SCL pin on the MAX30100 module to the A5 pin on your Arduino board.
Next, you will need to install the MAX30100 library for Arduino. You can do this by going to the "Sketch" menu, selecting "Include Library", and then selecting "MAX30100".

Once the library is installed, you can use the following code to read data from the MAX30100 module and display it on the serial monitor:
